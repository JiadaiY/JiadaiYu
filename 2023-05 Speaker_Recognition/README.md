Group member: Jiadai Yu, Shu Wang, Yulu Jiang 

Objective 
The prediction task is to recognize the speaker through classification. Our raw data source will be the lecture recordings from the courses we had these two semesters. The model will be trained to pre-process input speech, extract audio features of professors, and perform classification tasks. We aim to develop a model that can learn the unique voice feature of each professor, then extract features of the test audio and recognize the speaking individual. 
We primarily focus on speaker recognition, also known as speaker identification and verification in many research. We aim to identify the speaker by extraction, characterization and recognition of the audio. Our project does not aim to perform speech recognition, which is to recognize the words said in the speech and convert to text information.
