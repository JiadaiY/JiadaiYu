The objective of this research is to develop an efficient machine learning model for online payment fraud detection. The aim is to automatically identify fraudulent transactions, enabling timely intervention, thus protecting personal property security while safeguarding the reputation of banks or companies. 
This research will leverage the knowledge and skills acquired during the MSBA course to conduct a thorough investigation, encompassing exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression and classification, decision trees, neural network), and visualization.
